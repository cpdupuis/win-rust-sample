# win-rust-sample

The simplest Rust equivalent (that I have been able to implement so far) to this [Your First Windows Program](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/your-first-windows-program) example.

If you have suggestions on how to make it simpler, please open an issue.

## Dependencies

The only dependency for this project is the [windows](https://crates.io/crates/windows) crate.

## What does it do?

It shows an empty window. If you click on the X to close the window, the window closes and the application exits.
